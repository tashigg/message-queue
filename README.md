### Checking Out

When checking out, be sure to initialize and update submodules:

```
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
```

The `rumqtt` submodule points to a fork in our organization, so we can make and commit modifications as needed.
GitHub Actions is enabled on the repository. Any value-added changes can be upstreamed for some community goodwill.

(`git subtree` is gross.)
