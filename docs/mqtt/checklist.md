- [ ] 3.14.1-1: The Client or Server MUST validate that reserved bits are set to 0. If they are not zero it sends a DISCONNECT packet with a Reason code of 0x81 (Malformed Packet) as described in [section 4.13](https://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v5.0/os/mqtt-v5.0-os.html#S4_13_Errors)
- [ ] 3.14.2-1: The Client or Server sending the DISCONNECT packet MUST use one of the DISCONNECT Reason Code values
- [ ] 3.14.2-2: The Session Expiry Interval MUST NOT be sent on a DISCONNECT by the Server

- [ ] 3.15.2-3: The sender MUST NOT send this property if it would increase the size of the AUTH packet beyond the Maximum Packet Size specified by the receiver
## 4 Operational Behavior
### 4.1 Session State
- [ ] 4.1.0-1: The Client and Server MUST NOT discard the Session State while the Network Connection is open
- [ ] 4.1.0-2: The Server MUST discard the Session State when the Network Connection is closed and the Session Expiry Interval has passed
### 4.2 Network Connections
- [ ] 4.2-1: A Client or Server MUST support the use of one or more underlying transport protocols that provide an ordered, lossless, stream of bytes from the Client to Server and Server to Client
### 4.3 QoS
- [ ] 4.3.1-1: MUST send a PUBLISH packet with QoS 0 and DUP flag set to 0
- [ ] 4.3.2-1: MUST assign an unused Packet Identifier each time it has a new Application Message to publish
- [ ] 4.3.2-2: MUST send a PUBLISH packet containing this Packet Identifier with QoS 1 and DUP flag set to 0
- [ ] 4.3.2-3: MUST treat the PUBLISH packet as “unacknowledged” until it has received the corresponding PUBACK packet from the receiver
- [ ] 4.3.2-4: MUST respond with a PUBACK packet containing the Packet Identifier from the incoming PUBLISH packet, having accepted ownership of the Application Message
- [ ] 4.3.2-5: After it has sent a PUBACK packet the receiver MUST treat any incoming PUBLISH packet that contains the same Packet Identifier as being a new Application Message, irrespective of the setting of its DUP flag
- [ ] 4.3.3-1: MUST assign an unused Packet Identifier when it has a new Application Message to publish
- [ ] 4.3.3-2: MUST send a PUBLISH packet containing this Packet Identifier with QoS 2 and DUP flag set to 0
- [ ] 4.3.3-3: MUST treat the PUBLISH packet as “unacknowledged” until it has received the corresponding PUBREC packet from the receiver
- [ ] 4.3.3-4: MUST send a PUBREL packet when it receives a PUBREC packet from the receiver with a Reason Code value less than 0x80. This PUBREL packet MUST contain the same Packet Identifier as the original PUBLISH packet
- [ ] 4.3.3-5: MUST treat the PUBREL packet as “unacknowledged” until it has received the corresponding PUBCOMP packet from the receiver
- [ ] 4.3.3-6: MUST NOT re-send the PUBLISH once it has sent the corresponding PUBREL packet
- [ ] 4.3.3-7: MUST NOT apply Message expiry if a PUBLISH packet has been sent
- [ ] 4.3.3-8: MUST respond with a PUBREC containing the Packet Identifier from the incoming PUBLISH packet, having accepted ownership of the Application Message
- [ ] 4.3.3-9: If it has sent a PUBREC with a Reason Code of 0x80 or greater, the receiver MUST treat any subsequent PUBLISH packet that contains that Packet Identifier as being a new Application MessageIf it has sent a PUBREC with a Reason Code of 0x80 or greater, the receiver MUST treat any subsequent PUBLISH packet that contains that Packet Identifier as being a new Application Message
- [ ] 4.3.3-10: Until it has received the corresponding PUBREL packet, the receiver MUST acknowledge any subsequent PUBLISH packet with the same Packet Identifier by sending a PUBREC. It MUST NOT cause duplicate messages to be delivered to any onward recipients in this case
- [ ] 4.3.3-11: MUST respond to a PUBREL packet by sending a PUBCOMP packet containing the same Packet Identifier as the PUBREL
- [ ] 4.3.3-12: After it has sent a PUBCOMP, the receiver MUST treat any subsequent PUBLISH packet that contains that Packet Identifier as being a new Application Message
- [ ] 4.3.3-13: MUST continue the QoS 2 acknowledgement sequence even if it has applied message expiry
### 4.4 Message Delivery Retry
- [ ] 4.4.0-1: When a Client reconnects with Clean Start set to 0 and a session is present, both the Client and Server MUST resend any unacknowledged PUBLISH packets (where QoS > 0) and PUBREL packets using their original Packet Identifiers. This is the only circumstance where a Client or Server is REQUIRED to resend messages. Clients and Servers MUST NOT resend messages at any other time
- [ ] 4.4.0-2: If PUBACK or PUBREC is received containing a Reason Code of 0x80 or greater the corresponding PUBLISH packet is treated as acknowledged, and MUST NOT be retransmitted
### 4.5 Message Receipt
- [ ] 4.5.0-1: When a Server takes ownership of an incoming Application Message it MUST add it to the Session State for those Clients that have matching Subscriptions
- [ ] 4.5.0-2: The Client MUST acknowledge any Publish packet it receives according to the applicable QoS rules regardless of whether it elects to process the Application Message that it contains
### 4.6 Message Ordering
- [ ] 4.6.0-1: When the Client re-sends any PUBLISH packets, it MUST re-send them in the order in which the original PUBLISH packets were sent (this applies to QoS 1 and QoS 2 messages)
- [ ] 4.6.0-2: The Client MUST send PUBACK packets in the order in which the corresponding PUBLISH packets were received (QoS 1 messages)
- [ ] 4.6.0-3: The Client MUST send PUBREC packets in the order in which the corresponding PUBLISH packets were received (QoS 2 messages)
- [ ] 4.6.0-4: The Client MUST send PUBREL packets in the order in which the corresponding PUBREC packets were received (QoS 2 messages)
- [ ] 4.6.0-5: When a Server processes a message that has been published to an Ordered Topic, it MUST send PUBLISH packets to consumers (for the same Topic and QoS) in the order that they were received from any given Client
- [ ] 4.6.0-6: By default, a Server MUST treat every Topic as an Ordered Topic when it is forwarding messages on Non‑shared Subscriptions.
### 4.7 Topic Name and Topic Filters
- [ ] 4.7.0-1: The wildcard characters can be used in Topic Filters, but MUST NOT be used within a Topic Name
- [ ] 4.7.1-1: The multi-level wildcard character MUST be specified either on its own or following a topic level separator. In either case it MUST be the last character specified in the Topic Filter
- [ ] 4.7.1-2: The single-level wildcard can be used at any level in the Topic Filter, including first and last levels. Where it is used, it MUST occupy an entire level of the filter
- [ ] 4.7.2-1: The Server MUST NOT match Topic Filters starting with a wildcard character (# or +) with Topic Names beginning with a $ character
- [ ] 4.7.3-1: All Topic Names and Topic Filters MUST be at least one character long
- [ ] 4.7.3-2: Topic Names and Topic Filters MUST NOT include the null character (Unicode U+0000)
- [ ] 4.7.3-3: Topic Names and Topic Filters are UTF-8 Encoded Strings; they MUST NOT encode to more than 65,535 bytes
- [ ] 4.7.3-4: When it performs subscription matching the Server MUST NOT perform any normalization of Topic Names or Topic Filters, or any modification or substitution of unrecognized characters
### 4.8 Subscriptions
- [ ] 4.8.2-1: A Shared Subscription's Topic Filter MUST start with $share/ and MUST contain a ShareName that is at least one character long
- [ ] 4.8.2-2: The ShareName MUST NOT contain the characters "/", "+" or "#", but MUST be followed by a "/" character. This "/" character MUST be followed by a Topic Filter
- [ ] 4.8.2-3: the Server MUST respect the granted QoS for the Client's subscription
- [ ] 4.8.2-4: the Server MUST complete the delivery of the message to that Client when it reconnects
- [ ] 4.8.2-5: If the Client's Session terminates before the Client reconnects, the Server MUST NOT send the Application Message to any other subscribed Client
- [ ] 4.8.2-6: If a Client responds with a PUBACK or PUBREC containing a Reason Code of 0x80 or greater to a PUBLISH packet from the Server, the Server MUST discard the Application Message and not attempt to send it to any other Subscriber
### 4.9 Control Flow
- [ ] 4.9.0-1: The Client or Server MUST set its initial send quota to a non-zero value not exceeding the Receive Maximum
- [ ] 4.9.0-2: Each time the Client or Server sends a PUBLISH packet at QoS > 0, it decrements the send quota. If the send quota reaches zero, the Client or Server MUST NOT send any more PUBLISH packets with QoS > 0
- [ ] 4.9.0-3: The Client and Server MUST continue to process and respond to all other MQTT Control Packets even if the quota is zero
### 4.12 Enhanced Authentication
- [ ] 4.12.0-1: If the Server does not support the Authentication Method supplied by the Client, it MAY send a CONNACK with a Reason Code of 0x8C (Bad authentication method) or 0x87 (Not Authorized) as described in [section 4.13](https://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v5.0/os/mqtt-v5.0-os.html#S4_13_Errors) and MUST close the Network Connection
- [ ] 4.12.0-2: If the Server requires additional information to complete the authentication, it can send an AUTH packet to the Client. This packet MUST contain a Reason Code of 0x18 (Continue authentication)
- [ ] 4.12.0-3: The Client responds to an AUTH packet from the Server by sending a further AUTH packet. This packet MUST contain a Reason Code of 0x18 (Continue authentication)
- [ ] 4.12.0-4: The Server can reject the authentication at any point in this process. It MAY send a CONNACK with a Reason Code of 0x80 or above as described in [section 4.13](https://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v5.0/os/mqtt-v5.0-os.html#S4_13_Errors), and MUST close the Network Connection
- [ ] 4.12.0-5: If the initial CONNECT packet included an Authentication Method property then all AUTH packets, and any successful CONNACK packet MUST include an Authentication Method Property with the same value as in the CONNECT packet
- [ ] 4.12.0-6: If the Client does not include an Authentication Method in the CONNECT, the Server MUST NOT send an AUTH packet, and it MUST NOT send an Authentication Method in the CONNACK packet
- [ ] 4.12.0-7: If the Client does not include an Authentication Method in the CONNECT, the Client MUST NOT send an AUTH packet to the Server
- [ ] 4.12.1-1: If the Client supplied an Authentication Method in the CONNECT packet it can initiate a re-authentication at any time after receiving a CONNACK. It does this by sending an AUTH packet with a Reason Code of 0x19 (Re-authentication). The Client MUST set the Authentication Method to the same value as the Authentication Method originally used to authenticate the Network Connection
- [ ] 4.12.1-2: If the re-authentication fails, the Client or Server SHOULD send DISCONNECT with an appropriate Reason Code as described in [section 4.13](https://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v5.0/os/mqtt-v5.0-os.html#S4_13_Errors), and MUST close the Network Connection
### 4.13 Handling Errors
- [ ] 4.13.1-1: When a Server detects a Malformed Packet or Protocol Error, and a Reason Code is given in the specification, it MUST close the Network Connection
- [ ] 4.13.2-1: The CONNACK and DISCONNECT packets allow a Reason Code of 0x80 or greater to indicate that the Network Connection will be closed. If a Reason Code of 0x80 or greater is specified, then the Network Connection MUST be closed whether or not the CONNACK or DISCONNECT is sent
